## R Markdown

### Here are some of my favorite things:
- Video gaming

- Ice skating

- Bouldering

- Hanging out with friends and family

- Taking my cat Nikko out for car rides


## Average MPG
```{r avgmpg}
avgmpgdata <- mpg %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
  summarize(hwy = mean(hwy), cty = mean(cty))

g <- ggplot(data = avgmpgdata)
g + geom_col(aes(x = cty, y = manufacturer, fill = manufacturer)) +
  ggtitle("Average Miles per Gallon for City Driving by Manufacturer", subtitle = "Data on vehicles from 1999 to 2008 for popular models of cars") +
  theme(legend.position="none") 
```
